# LibraryOfThings
Project that enables sharing things among small societies.<br>
In our case it will be made for the use of dormitory students, to share books and couple of other tools.

## Idea

Our aim is to create network of people using the application among students from different rooms. We want to include Arduino Uno to manage users and things in library,
NFC cards or key rings to authenticate users and other technologies that will enable us to create friendly interface of the app.

### Why not online?

Simply put- not everything we use can be in digital version. If we count tools such as keyboard cleaner, why should everyone have one? We can basically share it among us but we need to manage it somehow.

### Got and idea?

This project is always open for some external advices. This is a social open-source project so don't bother to inform us or to make pull requests if you want to improve something.
